bbq
===

Simple static file web server (based on connect) that I can start from any directory.

	npm install

Then just execute **bbq.js** from the directory that you want to be the root of
your web server.

Better yet, put this in your shell start-up script:

	alias bbq='$BBQ_HOME/bbq.js'

...where BBQ_HOME is the path to your **bbq** directory.
